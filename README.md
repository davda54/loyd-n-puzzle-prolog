# Loyd's `n`-puzzle
Programming assigment in nonprocedural programming class: Prolog program solving [Loyd's `n`-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). When given enough time, the program should solve arbitrarily large square board. The problem is that there is no hash table in Prolog, which makes the solver quite slow.
